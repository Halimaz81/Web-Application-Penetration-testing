# Web-Application-Penetration-testing
This project performs a black-box web application penetration test on WestJet’s public website as part of a bug bounty–style assessment. Reconnaissance and testing were conducted using both automated tools and manual techniques to evaluate the application’s exposure to common web vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, broken access control, path traversal, and insecure direct object references (IDORs). Throughout the assessment, defensive mechanisms such as input sanitisation, authentication controls, rate limiting, CAPTCHAs, and a web application firewall were analysed. The results indicate a strong security posture, with effective controls preventing exploitation, while also highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring, secure configuration, and regular security testing.
